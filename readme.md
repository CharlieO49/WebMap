Lab 3, first web map.

I did my web map on a trail that me and my friends would bike during our first year at Appstate. It is a shorter trail from Doughton Hall to Brookshire Trail. Since we did not have cars on campus it was easier to just ride our bikes along the road to get to the trail head. One of the major functions used in my map was the layer.bindtooltip function. This allowed me to add information to all of my map pins in the form of names. These were not stops but more just points of interest. Another major function used was the filter function. This allowed me to make specific changes to features based on if they were points or lines. The most important function I used was provided to me by Leaftlet, which was the tilelayer function. This allowed me to attach a basemap and was the foundation of my web map.
